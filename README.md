Before anything, writing Go code needs a clear and sober mind. It isn't an easy journey ðŸ˜‚
Have room for making mistakes, take a walk, clear your mind then debug your code when you're rejuvenated. As a developer, that's how you grow.

In the func main you put your database credentials.
You can add and delete. 

You can modify this code as per your preference.
